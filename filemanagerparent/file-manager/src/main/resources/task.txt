Requirements:
Every user has its own directory (outside of webapp) : {root.dir}/{username} (ex. ‘c:\file-manager-files\adam’).
Keep the path to the users’ root directory in a property file (e.g. config.properties, for example root.dir= c:\\file-manager-files\\)
Each user can see/delete/upload only files from his own directory/
Home page should contain
the list of user’s files and links named ‘delete’ and ‘download’ near each file and a checkbox (sorry couldn’t find icon/control for checkbox ☺ )
Examle:
my_text_file.txt 		delete	 download
my_word_doc.docx 		delete	 download
a button named ‘Add’ for uploading a new file.
a button named ‘Zip and download’ which creates and downloads a zip file from selected files (checkboxes)

How to implement:
Create a servlet context listener which reads users.json and creates directories for users who don’t yet have directory in root.dir
Create DeleteServlet servlet which is responsible for deletion of specified file. It takes ‘fname’ parameter which is the file name which needs to be deleted.
Create DownloadServlet servlet which is responsible for downloading specified file. It takes ‘fname’ parameter which is the file name which needs to be downloaded.
Create UploadServlet servlet which is responsible for uploading a file to user’s directory.
Create DownloadZipServlet servlet which is responsible for downloading selected files as zip. It takes file (more than one) parameters which are selected file names.
